        <h1>Hello! <br> My name is Patrick Collins.</h1>
        <p>
            I am currently a student at Mid-State Technical College pursuing a degree in software development.
            Since a young age, I have always been fascinated by how software is built and have had a dream to be a developer for a long time. After an amazing opportunity to temporarily
            work as a QA tester on one of my all-time favorite game series Halo, it gave me the drive to pursue this dream.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond my professional aspirations, I find joy in exploring various hobbies and interests in my free time. Although I have many hobbies, my favorite would be gaming,
            both developing and enjoying the game myself. Outside of technology, you will often find me in the gym or outside running, as I am very passionate about fitness. Recently, I have set a goal
            of completing my first 5k and progressively moving up in length.
